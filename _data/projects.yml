- name: PhysGNN&#58; A Physics-Driven Graph Neural Network Based Model for Predicting Soft Tissue Deformation in Image-Guided Neurosurgery
  conf: NeurIPS2022
  authors: Yasmin Salehi, Dennis Giannacopoulos
  image_link: "assets/img/PhysGNN.png"
  descr: "TLDR: PhysGNN is a novel physics-driven graph neural network based model capable of accurately and efficiently approximating tissue deformation caused by applied forces by which 94-97% of errors are shown to be less than 1 mm&#8212;the precision in neurosurgery."

- name: Structure Aware Negative Sampling (SANS) in Knowledge Graphs
  conf: EMNLP 2020
  authors: Kian Ahrabian*, Aarash Feizi*, Yasmin Salehi*, William Hamilton, Joey Bose
  image_link: "assets/img/SANS.png"
  descr: "TLDR: SANS is a novel negative sampling method which generates negative samples from the k-hop neighborhood of nodes. SANS was shown to be competitive with SOTA methods and outperform sophisticated Generative Adversarial Network approaches."
